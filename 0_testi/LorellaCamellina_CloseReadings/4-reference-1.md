#####What it is

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukikaze), 
> _Yukikaze (雪風?) is Japanese for "Snow Wind"_

That's the poetic figure the author wants to donate. The natural phenomenon is embodied by light white material fluttering in the air, just like snoflakes in the wind. It looks enchanting, pure, hypnotic. 
Anyhow, the main purpose remains to visualize the audio spectrum of an ongoing melody. Result, a subtle device of sound analysis, displaying frequences.

#####What it could mean

In my opinion the outcome is so astonishing it does not need to mean anything. The artiicial blizzard causes so much poetry and hypnotism we are glad of being caught in synesthesia. 

As I have not been able to get to any document, interview or article in an alphabet of my knowledge, I guess this daintiness might be due to the "hypersensibility" of an Oriental culture. (By that I mean I also read something like _"men please i want to make one for my roooommmm"_ between comments about Yukikaze on Youtube, not from the East of World).

#####How it works

As I said, I did not find usefull documentation to deeply understand what and how everything goes from a song, to Arduino, to fans, to fake snow. The crucial issue seems to be fans' adjustment: how often turn them on and off reacting to frequences.
Below, the two most interesting chat between the author and YouTube users.

Anyhow, always reading the comments mentioned above, I encountered lots of disappointment in not being able to take a look at a coding reference. I assume it is not easy to get a result like Yukikaze, talking about sound frequences. It all ends up instilling the doubt: is it really doing what the title of a YouTube video suggests or not?

#####What if . . .

This meaningless installation leads to no needs of parallelism. It is what it is, as Susan Sontag says. We have to take it for what it is. It is a sound visualization allowed by nowadays technology mixed to a sensible soul. 

It would be interesting to see the behaviour of the installation with a more rhythmically melody. It would be easier to understand how it all works, as it would be showing another significant interval of response of the fans involved. Comparing the two situations we should understand a bit more about the programming.
