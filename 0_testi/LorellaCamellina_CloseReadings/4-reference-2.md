#####What it is

Basically, ground noise, within certain terms, helps keeping attention high. On the other hand, we need a volume level that preserves our concentration. The perfect solution can be achieved working on the relation between general sound level and distracting noises levels. Using CIID's words:

> _"distracting noises are not loud on an absolute scale, they are loud relative to the average sound level. If that level is increased, undesirable sounds have to be much louder for them to be distracting"_

This means we may need more ground noise to stay focused. That's what Hover is for. It detects the general sound level of a room, giving a constant visible feedback on how loud you are being and, if necessary, it also introduce white noise in the ambient. The perfect example of this counter-intuitive flow is when you put your earphones on to insulate from ground noise. It may come that moment you feel the music is too loud so, you end up turning down the volume. It means ground noise has dropped down, too. It is happening to me right now, while writing.

#####What it could mean

I had never thought about how a device like this could be useful. It reveals the importance of background noise while working. I see Hover as a tool in line with nowadays working practices. We must be used to work in team, mandatory. It is not unusual to be asked to work in open spaces (even though the real ultimate tendence is in opposition). More and more often there is no even a real office, work takes place on our digital desktop and who cares where we are. The same goes for school.

#####How it works

Hover features two elements. First one:

> _"features a transparent tube that contains a ball that levitates inside it. It uses a microphone to detect the general sound level of a room. The louder the room gets, the higher the balls levitates. The people around it need to be quieter for the ball to be lower. If the sound reaches a certain threshold, the ball flies out of the tube"._

Second element is a white noise generator to increase the overall sound level.

#####What if . . .

Hover could became a default element of a stereo system in open spaces. It would be nice to make it open source and spread it everywhere. It would be interesting to have a constat feedback on noise.
