###I'm (not) there _(still work in progress)_
#####by Francesca Guzzini

####Abstact
Being someone has several meanings, identity and place too. 
This project analyse the multiple identities, the physical and virtual structure which supports them and the relationship which occur between what is inside and/or what is outside of a restrict community such as the UniRSM. 
Somehow, members from this community are travelers and exchange information among them and with the world outside. This happens both virtually and physically even though Saint Marino is well known for being one of the smallest nation in the world. Even its geographical location, upon the Titano, suggests that spreading to the rest of the world would be difficult. It ain't.

####Concept
Each one from the UniRSM community has the potential to spread his identity all over the world and bring with him the identity of the community. Have you ever thought about this in that way? 
Everyday we built a path of our travel, phisically and virtually.
The IP address which is given to my personal internet connection every eight hours represent my virtual myself. From the moment I start to navigate, this does not remain only a bunch of bytes in a virtual domain but somehow my virtual identity is transpose to a physical domain, the one of server which host my virtual myself.

####Dataset
From the logs table the firewall generates, I will take those data:
-Source address
-Destination address
-Elapsed time

####Dataviz
The data which an IP stores will be tranformed in graphic representations
each IP can be converted in an [Identicon] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) and [this guy] (http://blog.docuverse.com/ ) talks a lot about them. [Blog Reference] (http://www.k2g2.org/blog:bit.craft:stitchy_identicons)

Each representation should be imagined as in motion and it will disappear at the end of a chosen time interval, due to the elapsed time of the connection.
In the first place, we have a screen; at the very moment a connection is generated, an Identicon will appear at center (the vision I want to convey is that Saint Marino somehow is the center of the world). This Identicon is a user which will have several connections to different internet services located in every possible part of the world. Each time, this IP, translated in an Identicon, will connect to a different server it will appear there, where the real server that host that IP is actually located, this can be solved by any IP tracer available on the web. Follows an example of what I'm trying to explain:
